# Event Management

Scripts for events and the Events page (EV-01). Setup detail:
[Event Management](../admin-guide/events.md).

Before you start: an org from [Before you test](before-you-test.md), with Core and Event
Management deployed. Event Management works on the platform-only shape. Give the testers their
roles on the **Access** page: admin (Admin role), staff (Program Staff role) and read-only (Read
Only role). Each gets its Events permission set from the role.

## T-EV-01: Create an Event and Find It

**Purpose:** confirm an event saves with its rules and shows on the Events page.
**Prerequisites:** staff.
**Smoke:** yes

| Step | Action | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open the **BarnCRM Events** app. | It opens on **Events Home**, then **Events**, **Reports** and **Error Log** last. The page says nothing is coming up and offers **New Event**. |
| 2 | Click **New Event**. Name `Spring Gala`, Start next Saturday 6:00 PM, End the same day 5:00 PM, save. | Refused: `End must be after Start.` |
| 3 | Set End to 10:00 PM, Capacity `0`, save. | Refused: `Capacity must be at least 1. Leave it empty for no limit.` |
| 4 | Set Capacity `200`, Venue Name `Town Hall`, save. | Saved as **Draft**, **In Person**. The page shows the highlights, a **Details** tab and the related lists in the sidebar. |
| 5 | Back on **Events Home**. | `Spring Gala` is listed with next Saturday's date, `6:00 PM to 10:00 PM`, a grey **Draft** badge and `Town Hall`. |
| 6 | Create `Admin Week` from next Monday 9:00 AM to next Wednesday 5:00 PM, Format **Virtual**, Online Link `https://example.org/join`. | On **Events Home** its dates read Monday to Wednesday and **Where** says `Online`. |

**Cleanup:** None.

## T-EV-02: Repeat an Event

**Purpose:** confirm Repeat Event makes draft occurrences in one series.
**Prerequisites:** staff, `Admin Week` from T-EV-01.

| Step | Action | Expected result |

| 2 | Choose **Every Month**, set **Occurrences to Add** to `60`. | **Repeat Event** is disabled. |
| 3 | Set it to `2`, click **Repeat Event**. | A message says `2 occurrences added as drafts.` Two more `Admin Week` events are listed a month and two months on, each **Draft**, Monday to Wednesday. |
| 4 | Open the first `Admin Week`. | **Occurrences** in the sidebar lists the two copies. Each copy's **Series** is the first event. |

**Cleanup:** Delete the copies as admin.

## T-EV-03: Read-Only and Staff Access

| 3 | Price `50`, Quantity `80`, save. Add `Student`, Price `20`, Quantity `40`. | Both listed, `$50.00` and `$20.00`, each **Active**. A warning says the quantities add up to 120, more than the capacity of 100. |
| 4 | **New Promo Code**: `early`, Percent, Discount Value `120`, save. | Refused: `A percent discount can be at most 100.` |
| 5 | Discount Value `10`, Ticket Type `General`, save. | Listed as `early`, `10%`, `General`, **Active**. |
| 6 | Add another code `EARLY`, Amount `5`. | Refused: the code `EARLY` is already used for this event. |
| 7 | Edit `early`: Valid Until yesterday. | It shows **Expired**. |
| 8 | Delete `Student` from its row menu and confirm. | It is gone and the capacity warning with it. |
| 9 | On **Events Home**, **Repeat Event** for this event, one occurrence. Open the copy's **Tickets**. | `General` is there with its price; no promo codes. |
